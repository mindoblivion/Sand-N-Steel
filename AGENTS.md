## Project

"Sand & Steel: 3D Gladiator Arena RPG" — a Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + three.js
(react-three-fiber) single-page game, exported from Google AI Studio. There is **no backend**:
player progress is stored in `localStorage` (`src/services/storage.ts`).

## Running it (Base44 dev environment)

- `docker compose -f docker-compose.base44.yml up -d` starts the Vite dev server on host port 3000.
- Dependencies are installed from the committed `bun.lock` at container startup
  (`bun install --frozen-lockfile`); `node_modules` lives in the `web_node_modules` volume, not in the repo.
- Live reload (Vite HMR) is on — edits under `/app` appear without a rebuild or restart.

## Non-obvious notes

- **No environment variables are required to boot.** The upstream README mentions `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
  but `@google/genai` is an unused dependency — nothing under `src/` reads it.
- `firebase-applet-config.json` holds a hardcoded Firebase config used only by the optional Google
  Drive cloud-save (`src/services/googleAuth.ts`, `googleDrive.ts`, `components/hub/GoogleDriveSyncModal.tsx`).
  Google sign-in needs the serving host to be an authorized domain in that Firebase project, so sign-in
  is expected to fail in the sandbox; the game plays fully without it. Do not treat sign-in errors as a boot defect.
- `vite.config.ts` already sets `host: '0.0.0.0'`, `port: 3000` and `allowedHosts: true`, so the preview host
  is accepted as-is and no host/origin override is needed.
- The AI Studio ZIP contained `public/models/arena_roman.glb.backup.glb`, a throwaway backup produced by
  `scripts/gltf-transform-optimize.js` and referenced nowhere; it was excluded on import.

## Verifying

- `curl -s localhost:3000/` should return the HTML shell (title: "Sand & Steel: 3D Gladiator Arena RPG").
- Then open the preview: the title screen renders, and New Game → character creation → 3D city hub should work.
- `bun run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) type-checks the project.
