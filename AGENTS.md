## Project

"Sand & Steel: 3D Gladiator Arena RPG" — a Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + three.js
(react-three-fiber) single-page game, exported from Google AI Studio. There is **no backend**:
player progress is stored in `localStorage` (`src/services/storage.ts`).

## Running it (Base44 dev environment)

- `docker compose -f docker-compose.base44.yml up -d` starts the Vite dev server on host port 3000.
- Dependencies are installed from the committed `bun.lock` at container startup
  (`bun install --frozen-lockfile`); `node_modules` lives in the `web_node_modules` volume, not in the repo.
- Live reload (Vite HMR) is on — edits under `/app` appear without a rebuild or restart.

## Non-obvious notes

- **No environment variables are required to boot.** The upstream README mentions `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
  but `@google/genai` is an unused dependency — nothing under `src/` reads it.
- `firebase-applet-config.json` holds a hardcoded Firebase config used only by the optional Google
  Drive cloud-save (`src/services/googleAuth.ts`, `googleDrive.ts`, `components/hub/GoogleDriveSyncModal.tsx`).
  Google sign-in needs the serving host to be an authorized domain in that Firebase project, so sign-in
  is expected to fail in the sandbox; the game plays fully without it. Do not treat sign-in errors as a boot defect.
- `vite.config.ts` already sets `host: '0.0.0.0'`, `port: 3000` and `allowedHosts: true`, so the preview host
  is accepted as-is and no host/origin override is needed.
- The AI Studio ZIP contained `public/models/arena_roman.glb.backup.glb`, a throwaway backup produced by
  `scripts/gltf-transform-optimize.js` and referenced nowhere; it was excluded on import.
- The AI Studio export shipped two import bugs that broke the 3D screens and were fixed on import:
  a duplicated `Banner` import in `src/components/3d/city/IshtarGatehouse.tsx` (Vite "Identifier already declared"),
  and `React.lazy()` calls in `src/App.tsx` that expected a default export from `CityHubScene`/`DuelScene`,
  which only export named components. If a 3D screen ever goes blank after re-importing, check these first.
- `public/models/arena_roman.glb` is the player's character model: a 66-joint UE-style skeleton (`root`,
  `pelvis`, `spine_01`-`03`, `arm`/`hand_l`/`hand_r`/`leg`) with 178 animation clips. `GladiatorMesh` clones it
  per fighter, attaches the procedural sword/shield to the `hand_r`/`hand_l` bones, and maps ~29 of the clips
  (`Walk`, `Sword_Attack`, `Sword_Regular_C`, `Defend`, `Roll`, `Hit_Chest`, `Death_A`, `Fighting_Idle`, ...).
  If the file is missing or not rigged it silently falls back to a procedural gladiator, so check the network
  tab for `/models/arena_roman.glb` when the character looks blocky.
- **Tailwind's content scanner walks `public/`.** Tailwind 4 auto-detects sources across the project and only
  skips extensions it knows to be binary (`.ogg` is fine), so a multi-MB `.glb` was read as text — memory grew
  ~100 MB/s until the dev process was killed and the container restart-looped (symptoms: `bun`/`vite` dying with
  SIGKILL/segfault, and a huge untracked `core` dump appearing at the repo root — delete it before committing).
  `src/index.css` now carries `@source not "../public";` (the `not` form needs Tailwind >= 4.1; 4.3.3 is installed).
  Verified after the fix: the CSS build takes ~1 s and the dev server holds steady around 190 MB, with no SIGKILLs.
  `curl 'localhost:3000/src/index.css?direct'` forces a full scan if you need to re-check. Add the same exclusion
  for any new large non-audio asset folder under `public/`.
- `scripts/gltf-transform-optimize.js` (`bun run compress:glb`) runs inside the `web` container and shrinks a
  model with dedup/weld/resample/quantize — useful for load time. Pass `--no-draco`: Draco output needs
  `useGLTF(url, true)` plus a decoder, which `GladiatorMesh` does not configure. KHR_mesh_quantization output
  is fine. Note it writes a `.backup.glb` beside the file when input and output are the same path.

- **All player-acquirable items live in `src/data/itemsDB.ts`** (single source of truth): `ITEMS_DB`,
  `ALL_WEAPONS`, `ALL_ARMORS`, `ITEMS_BY_CATEGORY` (`weapon` + one key per armor slot) and `getItemById()`.
  `ALL_WEAPONS[2]` is the spare starter weapon (`STARTING_SPARE_WEAPON`, used by `services/storage.ts` and
  `CharacterCreation.tsx`), so **keep the array order when appending** new entries. Weapons may carry an
  optional `modelPath`; the five meshes in `public/models/weapons/` (gladius, spatha, dagger, dirk, shamshir)
  are single static unrigged meshes ~1 unit long, currently referenced as data only — nothing renders them yet.

## Verifying

- `curl -s localhost:3000/` should return the HTML shell (title: "Sand & Steel: 3D Gladiator Arena RPG").
- Live flow that works: title screen → character creation → **3D city hub** → `Colosseum` tab →
  `Enter Arena Duel` → `Step into Sand` → **3D duel arena**. The 3D scenes are heavy to build, so give them a
  few seconds after navigating.
- Landing on the title screen with a save already in `localStorage`, the tap should go straight to the city
  hub (the artwork's "CONTINUE" path), not to character creation. `TitleScreen` runs the tap handler from both
  a React `onClick` and a `window` listener, guarded by a ref; if a future edit re-introduces a double-fire,
  the symptom is a returning player dumped into character creation.
- **Short-landscape duel HUD.** On a phone held sideways (or any window flatter than tall with a height of
  520px or less) the duel HUD's stacked content (~400px) exceeded the viewport and pushed the bottom of the
  tactic dashboard below the fold. `src/index.css` carries an `@media (orientation: landscape) and
  (max-height: 520px)` block that compacts it, using the `.combat-hud` / `.combat-top` / `.vital-card` /
  `.hype-meter` / `.combat-log-items` / `.tactic-desc` hooks added in `CombatHUD`/`TurnActionPanel` (the
  tactic blurbs are hidden; name, cost, hit chance and damage stay). Those rules are unlayered, so they
  outrank Tailwind's utilities layer without `!important`. **Verification caveat:** the sandbox's preview
  browser only offers fixed viewport presets (no ~812x375), so the compacted layout was measured by replaying
  those declarations unconditionally over the live duel HUD — content dropped from 403px to 347px against a
  365px budget. A true 812x375 render is not reproducible here; check it on a real landscape phone.
- `bun run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) reports several **pre-existing** type errors inherited from the AI Studio export
  (e.g. `screen.orientation.lock` missing from the DOM lib, extra fields on `FighterStats`/`WeaponItem`,
  `isBone` on `Object3D`). Vite's dev server does not type-check, so they do not block the app — don't chase
  them as setup failures.
